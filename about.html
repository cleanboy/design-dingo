	    			<p>My name is Matthew Jonat and I am a web Developer. I'm currently 26 and living in Brighton, England. I love all things web development and code.</p>
	    			<p>Currently my skill set includes working with HTML, CSS, Javascript (but mostly jQuery these days) and a little bit of PHP (I also use git while developing...well I'm currently learning it but find it very useful).</p>
	    			<p>I am learning new things every day and loving it to be honest. I work mainly with Aptana Studio 3 for development as I find it to be the best editor I have found so far (I started with Dreamweaver and have used notepad++ but dont find either as good). I'm also very familiar with Photoshop inDesign and Flash (I know a bit of AS2 and AS3 but not that great to be honest...I'm fine making animations etc as well...).</p>
	    			<p>Other interests include music (something I could not live without) and just generally being social. If you would like to get in touch please use the contact form (on the menu above) and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
